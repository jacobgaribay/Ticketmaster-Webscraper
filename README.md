The TicketMaster Webscraper that I coded in python was my capstone project for my Python course I took at General Assembly. It's a script that retrieves the tour status of a music artist that the user inputs. The script will fetch up to 10 upcoming events. The script makes use of the "requests" library to interact with the Ticketmaster API and the "pandas" library to organize and display the tour information in a data frame.
